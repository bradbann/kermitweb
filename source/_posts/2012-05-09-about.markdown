KermIT integrates best of breed opensource components with a Web user interface
and dashboard to provide a central management solution for IT systems and
applications.

KermIT relies in the backend on
[Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet/ "Puppet")
and
[MCollective](http://puppetlabs.com/mcollective/introduction/ "MCollective").

The license of the developments is the GPL v.3 for the generic part of the
source code.
